i have learnt that deleting all my files from R deletes them from my computer :-(
I needed to redownload git to remove the git not found error message and how to link my git to R.

to create repository:
new repository on github, new proect -> version control -> add in url
to commit file:
commit -> add commit message -> click commit -> push to push this file to github repository
