WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Ella Simms]
Date: [05/02/2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
identify if the negative values for weight are impossible

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
5

Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
body_mass_mg

Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
if these negative values aren't valid they will bias the results

What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
filter them out, visualise with a boxplot and then remove if necessary


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
the different cases used in treatment
Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
1
Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
treatment

Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
if analysing control, this will create more than the 4 catergories need

What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
mutate the variables using if else or case when statements

OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - will address later if time]
negative values for mass
- [Issue 4 - uncertain how to handle]
date in ymd order, dmy is preferable but need to understand lubridate
- [Issue 5 - decided to leave as-is because...]



QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. how to use lubridate when it returns this error:
Warning message:
There was 1 warning in mutate().
ℹ In argument: date_egg_proper = lubridate::dmy(date_egg).
Caused by warning:
! All formats failed to parse. No formats found.
